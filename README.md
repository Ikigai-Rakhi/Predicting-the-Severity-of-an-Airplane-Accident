# Predicting-the-Severity-of-an-Airplane-Accident
Hacker Earth ML Challenge to Predict Severity of an Airplane Accident

# Problem Statement
You are required to build Machine Learning models to anticipate and classify the severity of any airplane accident based on past incidents. With this, all airlines, even the entire aviation industry, can predict the severity of airplane accidents caused due to various factors and, correspondingly, have a plan of action to minimize the risk associated with them.

## Data Set
The dataset consists of certain parameters recorded during the incident⁠ such as cabin temperature, turbulence experienced, number of safety complaints prior to the accident, number of days since the last inspection was conducted before the incident, an estimation of the pilot’s control given the various factors at play, and the likes. 
The entire dataset and problem statement can be found [here](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/airplane-accident-severity-hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge/)

## Approach
This was a classification task, so the following methodologies were applied:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Machines
4. Artificial Neural Networks

The repo also contains related tasks of Feature Engineering, applying baseline models and finding best paramaters using grid search.

## Result
The best accuracy was reached by ANN (0.9442), closely followed by SVM with an accuracy of 0.91

## Public Score: 80.56
